## About Me

I am a PhD student in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/) at the University of Manchester. My studies focus on representation theory, quantum algebra and rational Cherednik algebras. My supervisor is Dr Yuri Bazlov.

## Writings

The following are notes I have made during my studies. Some are based on lecture notes from courses I have taken, but the notes here are heavily edited, so any mistakes are likely my own. Feel free to email if typos/mistakes are found.

* Rational Cherednik algebras (MSc Dissertation) [pdf](./assets/files/rational_cherednik_algebras.pdf)

    I introduce Majid's cocycles on Hopf algebras, looking at how they can be used to "twist" certain algebras. After a brief introduction to the theory of reflection groups, I then define the rational Cherednik algebras. We finish with a discussion of a recent result that applies the twisting procedure to certain rational Cherednik algebras.

* Quantum algebra (MSc Project) [pdf](./assets/files/msc_draft.pdf)

    This was a short project with a focus on introducing the basic theory of Hopf algebras. We also prove that the Drinfeld double of S_3 is not isomorphic to a group algebra.  

* Lie Algebras [pdf](./assets/files/lie_algebras.pdf)

    Based on the lecture course given by Professor Alexander Premet at Manchester in 2019.

* Analysis, Random Walks and Groups [pdf](./assets/files/random_walk_other.pdf)

    Based on the lecture course given by Dr Tuomas Sahlsten at Manchester in 2019. Original notes can be found here: [link](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/tuomas.sahlsten/courses/arg_2019/default.htm).

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
