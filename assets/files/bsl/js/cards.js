      "question": "### What is meant by the statement \"some functions have side effects\"?",
      "answer": "In computer science, a function or expression is said to have a side effect if, in addition to returning a value, it also modifies some state or has an observable interaction with calling functions or the outside world. For example, a function might modify a global variable or static variable, modify one of its arguments, raise an exception, write data to a display or file, read data, or call other side-effecting functions. In the presence of side effects, a program's behavior may depend on history; that is, the order of evaluation matters. Understanding and debugging a function with side effects requires knowledge about the context and its possible histories.||<sup>ref: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_%28computer_science%29)</sup>"
