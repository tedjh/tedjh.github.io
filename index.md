## About

I am a PhD student in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/) at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/). My research focus is on representation theory, quantum algebra and rational Cherednik algebras. My supervisor is [Dr Yuri Bazlov](https://bazlov.uk/home/index.html).

Before Manchester, I briefly worked as a full-stack web developer. Prior to this I completed a Masters degree with a focus on Theoretical physics at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/).

## Exposition

Some material I have produced during my studies so far. <!--Some are based on lecture notes from courses I have taken, but the notes here are heavily edited, so any mistakes are likely my own. Feel free to email if typos/mistakes are found.-->

* **Hopf Algebras and Monoidal Categories**, April 2020. [link](./talk_bin/index.html)

    An introduction to Hopf algebras, motivating them by the fact their module categories are examples of (rigid) monoidal categories. We also relate quasitriangular Hopf algebras with braided monoidal categories. <!--These notes are based on several talks I gave in April 2020 to a reading group.-->

* **Rational Cherednik algebras**, MSc Dissertation, University of Manchester, 2019. [pdf](./assets/files/rational_cherednik_algebras.pdf)

    This is split into three parts, with the first being an introduction to cocycles on Hopf algebras and the Drinfeld twist. The second part covers the basic theory of reflection groups (real and complex) and a small amount of invariant theory. The last part collates the previous two with an introduction to rational Cherednik algebras and their generalisations, called braided Cherednik algebras. We finish with a very recent result that shows certain braided Cherednik algebras are Drinfeld twists of rational Cherednik algebras.

* **Quantum algebra**, MSc Project, University of Manchester,2019. [pdf](./assets/files/msc_draft.pdf)

    A short project introducing the basic theory of Hopf algebras. We also prove that the Drinfeld (or quantum) double of S_3 is not isomorphic to a group algebra.

* **Kochen-Specker Theorem**, Part III Essay, University of Cambridge, 2017. [pdf](./assets/files/kochen_specker.pdf)

    A short essay on the Kochen-Specker theorem in Quantum foundations.

<!--* Lie Algebras [pdf](./assets/files/lie_algebras.pdf)

    Based on the lecture course given by Professor Alexander Premet at Manchester in 2019.

* Analysis, Random Walks and Groups [pdf](./assets/files/random_walk_other.pdf)

    Based on the lecture course given by Dr Tuomas Sahlsten at Manchester in 2019. Original notes can be found here: [link](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/tuomas.sahlsten/courses/arg_2019/default.htm).

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
